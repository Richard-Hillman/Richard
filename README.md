FiIn stands for Film Independent. A site dedicated to empowering independent film makers and film industry professionals. In this application directors can submit a proposal to crowdfund a movie and then market and sell directly from our site. This empowers the indie film directors by giving them complete control of their cinematic experience and rights. This site will also be a portal for individuals to meet and discover other industry members. 

The first phase of this app will be to build the infrastructure for the crowd-sourcing and movie pitch UI.
